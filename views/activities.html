            Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and visit the volcano. However, there
            are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours,
            snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new
            dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and
            bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year.
            Many of these activities are in Merriton Landing, a rapidly developing area on the north side of
            Yellow Leaf Bay.
